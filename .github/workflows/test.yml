# Controls when the workflow will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch.
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events targeted at the "main" branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "test".
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up the Bun runtime environment.
      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          # Use the latest version of Bun. You can also pin to a specific version, e.g., '1.0.0'.
          bun-version: latest

      # Step 3: Installs project dependencies.
      # Using --frozen-lockfile is a best practice for CI to ensure deterministic builds
      # by installing the exact versions specified in bun.lockb.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

      # Step 4 (Optional but Recommended): Run the linter to check for code style issues.
      - name: Run linter
        run: bun run lint

      # Step 5: Runs the test suite using Bun's built-in test runner.
      # This command will execute all files ending in .test.ts.
      - name: Run tests
        run: bun test
